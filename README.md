2. Make sure you have all what's needed (see [What to bring](#what-to-bring)).
3. Clone this repository: https://github.com/Wopee-io/tf2025-ai-testing-agents-workshop.git
4. Install dependencies: `npm i` and Playwright Browsers: `npx playwright install`
5. Set up `.env` file (see [Set `.env` file](#set-env-file)).
6. Open the repository in VS Code.
7. Run the workshop: `npx playwright test`

### What to bring

- Laptop
- Christmas hat 🧑‍🎄 (mandatory)
- Admin rights on your laptop
- Browser (preferably Chrome)
- Create accounts for: GitHub and Wopee.io
- VS Code with Copilot (free will be enough) 
- Cursor (optional)

### Set up VS Code and Playwright

- Install Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/download/
- Set up VS Code and Playwright: https://playwright.dev/docs/getting-started-vscode

Note: Users should have admin rights on their laptops, which will make it easier for us to install and access other tools & resources (like AI APIs we will use).

### Clone this repository

- Windows users: Ctrl+Shift+P -> Git: Clone -> link to this repository
- Mac users: Cmd+Shift+P -> Git: Clone -> link to this repository

### Install dependencies and Playwright Browsers

```bash
npm i

npx playwright install
```

### Set `.env` file

Copy `.env.example` file to `.env` and set `WOPEE_API_KEY` to your Wopee.io project API key. Or just use what's in the file (should work). You can get your Wopee.io project API key from your Wopee.io project settings.

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Run example test:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

It should pass.

## About the Workshop

Forget slow, manual test scripts.

The future of testing is fast, smart, and powered by AI.

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll set up your real AI test agent from scratch. See how Playwright + Wopee.io can explore your app, map user flows, and write the tests for you. No more chasing flaky scripts. No more maintenance headaches.

## You’ll get

- Live demos. Real apps. No theory - just practical work.
- Experiments you can use on Monday. Not “someday.”
- A simple, clear path from manual testing to AI-driven automation.

**Build, run, and launch** your own AI testing agent. Then see why this isn’t hype anymore, it’s the new standard.

## What You’ll Learn

- How AI agents explore your app and write Playwright tests (live!)
- How to connect AI-powered test generation with your CI/CD
- Pro tips to debug and upgrade your new AI tests
- Visual assertions vs. AI-powered validations: what matters most?
- How to keep control, but let AI do the heavy lifting

## Walk Away With

- Your own working AI test agent
- Practical ways to boost your test coverage
- A clear vision for the future of testing

## Why Join?

Walk in with questions. Walk out with your first AI testing agent: running tests on a real app, plus a toolkit you can take back to your team.
Curious what AI can really do for QA? Want to get off the test automation hamster wheel? This workshop is your launchpad.
