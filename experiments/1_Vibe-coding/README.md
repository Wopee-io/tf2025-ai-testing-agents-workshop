# Experiment # 1: Vibe coding

1. Prompting specification

> Generate a detailed spec for a simple web app where kids can write letters to Santa, and parents can view all letters. The app should have user roles (kid, parent), authentication, letter creation/editing, and postcard generation features. The spec should include functional and non-functional requirements, UI/UX considerations, and data storage details.

My prompt was even messier. Here are the two prompts I used:

**Prompt 1**

> How to prepare specification for vibe coding tools like Lovable, Replit or similar?

**Prompt 2**

> Prepare template for me I will finalize in MD.

> I want to build an app for family members to write an letter to santa. Kids will securelly submit their wishes and parents might read it later. App will work locally in browser and for initial prototype all data will be stored in browser storage. User shoud be register, login and submit wishes. All cen submit what they want and parents can see all submittions including the one from kids. Kids can see only those they submitted.

2. Save your prompted spec in `experiments/1_Vibe-coding/spec.md`. We will use it in the next experiments.

3. Choose your favorite vibe coding tool.
   IMPORTANT: The tool must support web apps deployment so app can be accessed from internet.

Recommended tools:

- Lovable (https://lovable.ai)
- Bolt.new (https://bolt.new)
- Replit (https://replit.com)
- v0.dev (https://v0.dev)

4. Vibe code & test manually.

5. Deploy or find the public URL of your app.

## Examples I built

These are a few examples I built (NOT tested and pretty buggy). You can use them as inspiration or try to fork and modify them.
