# Experiment # 5: MCP Playwright

## Setup

1. Install [Playwright MCP](https://github.com/microsoft/playwright-mcp) server

First, install the Playwright MCP server with your client.

**Standard config** works in most of the tools:

```js
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "@playwright/mcp@latest"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```
